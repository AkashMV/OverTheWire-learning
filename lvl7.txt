level 7

our task here is to find a file somewhere on the server that
1) owned by bandit 7
2) owned by group bandit 6
3) 33 bytes in size

so that means we will have to work with user and file permissions..maybe chmod?

every file and folder in linux has an
1) owner
2) group

every owner has a UID
every group had a GID

file ownership is important for security
let use stat to check detailed info about the files

it seems that we can get use the find command to filter based on user and group name
so let us try it out

we can use find with tags -user and -group and -size
it returns a lot of info but most of it needs root access and hence throws an error
we can eliminate this error by using 2>/dev/null

so what does this do?

essentially this works with linux streams
linux has 3 standard streams
1) stdin
2) stdout
3) stderr

file descriptors 0,1,2 respectively.

error messages are printed to stderr
now our goal is to filter out the files and dirs that we do not have access to

so we move the error messages(ones w file descriptor id2)  to /dev/null
this discards anything given to it

so the command goes like

find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
now we can just cat into the result lessgoo!
