new day let us continue

we ls the directory
it seems that the file is full of gibberish
what may be the reason?

it seems that we have to use some kind of regular expression, 
otw website says that the password is preceded by several = characters

it seems that to get human readable data out of such a text, 
we can use the strings command to check for user readable txt in the file,
then we can take the output and put it into grep

it surely is interesting but i should find more use cases

command:
strings data.txt | grep ===
