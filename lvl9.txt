so we have huge data file
du says it is about 51KB

it seems that we can use the uniq command to get the uniq lines but in order for that to happen
the file needs to be sorted first

let us sort it out using the sort command
and uniq needs a specific -u tag to find only once occuring line

so using |
we do, 
sort data.txt | uniq -u and voila!
