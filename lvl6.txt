so here we go


we are in level 5 OTW
we are given a bunch of directories w prefix maybehere
I think the objective is to go through these dirs 
we are given hints that it is
	1) human readable
	2) 1033 bytes in size
	3) not executable

let us check how the dirs are structured

so it seems like there are files of different type in here
we can use the file command to  get details about the file

so like 'file myfile.txt'
it seems that we get such an error
file2: cannot open `file2' (No such file or directory)
i think we must investigate this issue

hmm so it seems like we do not have to go to all the directories one by one to get the information
using the -ls- command, we can just do 'ls *' to get details, and even better 'ls -la *' which 
gives us a lot more information, the -l in -la let us view it in a long listed format.

learning about glob patterns in linux 
they are also called wildcard pattern

okay so here is the thing

we can use the file * to list all the dirs
then we check those directories with file */*

here we use these so called glob patterns to get the executables
now we can use the -grep- command to get only human readable files ie ASCII
so it goes like grep 'ASCII text'
combined: file */{.,}* | grep 'ASCII text'
now we need to filter for size
since it is a smaller file we can use -v tag to remove any files that has
ASCII text, with very long lines
so ti goes 
file */{.,}* | grep 'ASCII text' | grep -v ', with very long lines'

du command gives us info about the disk space used
if we use -a tag along with it it gives us info about the files inside those dirs
and we use -b tag we get the memory in bytes
so we can now use du -b -a
and check by hand for a file that is of 1033 bytes but we can do better

let us use the grep command with it
du -b -a | grep '1033'

now we can cd in but my q is why cant i use the cat command to see it
oh it looks like we have to use the .before file2
so cat .file2
